# oceavol

Oceavol's goal is to be a next-generation mobile user interface named after "ocean flight" (vol d'oce√† in Catalan).
The goal of the UI is to provide an alternative to Android and Windows on x64-based tablets. Unlike other projects
that bundle a flavor of Gnome or KDE on top, Oceavol is being built to offer a unique environment and to be nimble.

More to be added as the project takes shape...
